Another Note:
We talked with Dr.Aysha and she gave a chance for the unhandled pull requests and the ones who didnot complete their work till tommorrow (Thursday 11:59PM).

Regarding the Backlog of sprint 4: i've done my best for making everyone choose a single front end user story from their userstories but they don't responde and i can't pick for them.
