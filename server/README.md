**i've tried to deploy on heroku and even start a new app but it didn't work however our frontend is on merged to the master branch**
**Our Apologies to the client**

Note:
Dr.Aysha approved for BI teams to submmit the rest of the work by 11:59 (2/4/2019)

Another Note:
We talked with Dr.Aysha and she gave a chance for the unhandled pull requests and the ones who didnot complete their work till tommorrow (Thursday 11:59PM).

Regarding the Backlog of sprint 4: i've done my best for making everyone choose a single front end user story from their userstories but they don't responde and i can't pick for them.
